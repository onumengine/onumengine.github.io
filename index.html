            <p>HOW IT ALL STARTED</p>
            <h1>The Story Behind The Process</h1>
            <p>
                It all started in 2018 when I watched the movie <em>The Internship</em>.
                I was inspired to build an application and I started researcing the Idea.
                I learnt Python and built a couple mobile apps with its <em>Kivy</em> 
                framework. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, I was building an app that needed me to access some advanced features
                of the smartphone it'll be running on. Python and Kivy couldn't access those features
                so I was stuck. I decided to learn Java,the official language for building Android
                apps, to complete my application and that was how my journey into mobile app 
                development started.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined the HNG i7 internship in 2019 as an Android developer and when I was done,
                I picked up Flutter development. Learning to build apps with flutter was the best thing
                that happened in my app development journey. I could build applications for android and 
                iOS devices, desktop computers and even web apps. I was blown away by Flutter's power
                and I've been building with it ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love to code and build applications but the part of coding that interests me the most 
                is experimenting with new technologies and APIs so I went into freelancing, picking
                projects with features that interest me. Since then, I've been able to work on apps with 
                interesting features like chatbots, video conferencing, in-app messaging and lots more.
                Samples of my code can be found on my 
                <a href="https://github.com/oumengine" target="blank">Github profile</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it's to build a new app or to add new features to an existing one, 
                <a href="#footer">get in touch</a> with me and we'll get that project off the ground.
