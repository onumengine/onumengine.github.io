                <p>
                    From the early days of building mobile apps with Python's kivy framework to building native
                    Android apps with Java and Kotlin and cross-platform apps with Flutter, I've picked up these
                    skills. They come in handy with mobile apps and some of them are even used in building
                    websites.

                        KTNotes is a psychology experiment.
                        It's a notekeeper app built with a unique color combination
                        and to support emojis and fancy text.<br><br> These features were integrated to
                        test how much a simple app can engage a user if its user experience is impressive.
                        <br><br>
                        It's a native android application built first with Java and then refactored
                        to Kotlin. It implements recyclerView, stores notes in a local SQLite database 
                        and is colorful and fun to use.
