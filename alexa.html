                <p>
                    From the early days of building mobile apps with Python's kivy framework to building native
                    Android apps with Java and Kotlin and cross-platform apps with Flutter, I've picked up these
                    skills. They come in handy with mobile apps and some of them are even used in building
                    websites.

                    <p>
                        MusicPlayer is a Flutter application that reaches deep into Android
                        platform APIs through method channels, an amazing feature of Flutter, to read 
                        and play music files stored on any android device. It can
                        modify files on a device and store data locally.

                    <h3>KTNotes</h3>
                    <p>
                        KTNotes is a psychology experiment.
                        It's a notekeeper app built with a unique color combination
                        and to supports emojis and fancy text. These features were integrated to
                        test how well a simple note app can engage a user.
                        It's a native android application built first with Java and then refactored
                        to Kotlin. It implements recyclerView, stores notes in a local SQLite database 
                        and is colorful and fun to use.
