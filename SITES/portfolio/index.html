                        From the early days of building mobile apps with Python's kivy framework to building native
                        Android apps with Java and Kotlin and cross-platform apps with Flutter, I've picked up these
                        skills. They come in handy with mobile apps and some of them are even used in building
                        websites.

                <p>HOW IT ALL STARTED</p>
                <h1>The Story Behind The Process</h1>
                <p>
                    It all started in 2018 when I watched the movie <em>The Internship</em>.
                    I was inspired to build an application and I started researcing the Idea.
                    I learnt Python and built a couple mobile apps with its <em>Kivy</em> 
                    framework. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, I was building an app that needed me to access some advanced features
                    of the smartphone it'll be running on. Python and Kivy couldn't access those features
                    so I was stuck. I decided to learn Java,the official language for building Android
                    apps, to complete my application and that was how my journey into mobile app 
                    development started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I joined the HNG i7 internship in 2019 as an Android developer and when I was done,
                    I picked up Flutter development. Learning to build apps with Flutter was the best thing
                    that happened in my app development journey. I could build applications for Android and 
                    iOS devices, desktop computers and even web apps. I was blown away by Flutter's power
                    and I've been building with it ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love to code and build applications but the part of coding that interests me the most 
                    is experimenting with new technologies and APIs so I went into freelancing, picking
                    projects with features that interest me. Since then, I've been able to work on apps with 
                    interesting features like chatbots, video conferencing, in-app messaging and lots more.
                    Samples of my code can be found on my 
                    <a href="https://github.com/oumengine" target="blank">Github profile</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether it's to build a new app or to add new features to an existing one, 
                    <a href="#footer">get in touch</a> with me and we'll get that project off the ground.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        A hybrid app runs on Android and iOS. Building a hybrid app is very
                        cost-effective since you'll be maintaining only one codebase and you won't
                        have to hire another developer to rebuild your app for a different platform.
                        You hybrid app is just <a href="#formSection">a few clicks</a> away.

                        I'll add any feature you want to your application. Yes, any feature. If your
                        app is built with Java, Kotlin or Flutter, that new feature is just one email

                        Your users' tendency to uninstall your app will drop considerably if you improve its
